## AWS Dashboard

Forked from https://github.com/bcarpio/aws_dashboard

Amazon Web Services Dashboard

Designed to help provide an inventory of what is set up in your AWS services. The primary purpose of this branch will be to allow developers to control how long their non-production systems are running. Since they do not need to be up 24/7, we are designing in the ability to launch for a specified number of hours and extend that if need be.
